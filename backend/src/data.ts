        description: "The rock phenomenon “The Wonderful Rocks” is situated at a distance of 4 km from the village of Asparuhovo, municipality of Dalgopol, county of Varna. It was declared a natural phenomenon by Decree of the Council of Ministers No 1869 of 17 February 1949 and covers an area of 12.5 ha on the shore of Tsonevo dam. The main road connecting Provadia and Aytos, as well as the railway line Varna - Plovdiv passes in close proximity. The Wonderful Rocks is a massif consisting of about ten beautiful rock needles, 40-50 meters high, shaped like castle towers. They were formed by the effect of water and wind on limestone. The rocks had formed directly by the banks of Tsonevo dam, where they are steepest and vertical. The phenomenon consists of three massifs. Three tunnels are dug through along their entire length, where an automobile road made of crushed stones passes. Since they can be seen from the main road, the rocks often attract travelers, which come by to enjoy the view.",
